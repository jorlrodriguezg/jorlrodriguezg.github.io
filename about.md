## Jorge Luis RodrÃ­guez Galvis

I am a PhD candidate at **King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)**, specializing in **remote sensing**, **machine learning**, and **biodiversity monitoring**. My work focuses on developing scalable methods for environmental monitoring in arid ecosystems using satellite and UAV imagery, with an emphasis on integrating AI models to assess vegetation structure, species composition, and ecological change over time.

My academic background bridges geodesy and ecological remote sensing, and I am particularly passionate about the intersection of foundation models and environmental sustainability. My research combines field-collected biodiversity data with advanced AI pipelines to enhance ecological monitoring in data-scarce regions.

I also collaborate on developing automated workflows for vegetation biomass estimation and spectral unmixing, and I maintain open-source code for remote sensing preprocessing and machine learning training pipelines.
